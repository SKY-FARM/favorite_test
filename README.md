# README

This is a programming test to measure your understanding of Ruby on Rails.

## Assignment

Add a feature for users to login to the site and save their favorite products and shops to a list so that they can easily navigate to their favorite shops or products.
- Logged-in users can both add and remove products/shops to/from the favorite list.
- Users can mark/unmark items as favorites whenever a shop or product is displayed, such as index or show view.
- Marking/unmarking items as favorites must be done using javascript without reloading a page.

## How to submit your solution
- Don't fork the repository on Github or submit a pull request directly there, as that would make your solution public for others to see. Instead, just clone the repository and work locally on it.
- When you're done, squash your work into a single commit and use git format-patch to generate a patch file. Email the patch file to us as your work sample submission. If you prefer to provide a GitHub's private gist or even do your work in a private repo and add us to it, that's also totally fine.
